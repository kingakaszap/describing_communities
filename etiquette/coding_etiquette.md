# Rules for working in this repo:

1. Annotate your code with helpful/informative comments with the # symbol.

2. Let the code breathe - try to space it reasonably. E.g. use a space before = and + operators.

3. Break down longer code into sections with ----, and give informative names to each section

4. Introduce the script - add name, date/time period, and some info on what the script is for.

5. Make sure all relevant scripts are reproducible.

6. Commit, pull, push. Add informative commit messages.
